title: SSH Tunneling with -L
date: 16/05/2011

Well hello.. this is my first blog post from my new iPad.. I ssh'd into my
server using Prompt, hopped onto  my blogging/projects VM, fired up VIM, and
away we go.. tonight I want to share a nugget of information that took me the
better part of a week to figure out: how to ssh tunnel using -L.~

So to be honest, I'm new at living on the CLI, but I love it.. recently my
co-worker Daniel showed me how to forward a remote webserver to my localhost
using ssh; pretty badass IMO. The syntax is simple: ssh -L
localport:localhost:remoteport remoteserver.

Let me explain this in a bit more detail. 

this is useful for local development

typing on ipad sucks in vim

forwarding ports to get around security measures and firewalls

set up next post talking about my local vm and cygwin
