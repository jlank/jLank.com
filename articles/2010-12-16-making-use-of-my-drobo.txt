title: Making Use of My Drobo
date: 16/12/2010

I've had a Drobo with DroboShare for almost a year now.  Right after I bought it and threw 4TB into it I just let it sit there and gather dust.  Now that I'm getting my technical house in order it is time to tidy up.  ~


I've installed dropbear, an SSH client for DroboShare, and I can now ssh into the box to access all of my files.  It is currently running the bourne shell with an embedded linux system; personally I'm used to the BASH shell.  Luckily, I installed BASH on the DroboShare, now I need to figure out how make the switch.


In addition to getting my NAS figured out, I've also been gaining interest in Unix after I started reading <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/">The Art of Unix Programming</a> by Eric Steven Raymond and <a href="http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/01">BSD for Linux Users</a> by Matthew Fuller.  I'm thinking about locking down my LAN and having a firewall/proxy infront of my NAS and other devices for security sake.  After the recent Gawker mishap, the inner paranoid geek in me (aka my co-worker Matt) finally convinced me to install LastPass and update my passwords to be more secure.  I've thought about doing it for some time, but after the slew of <a href="http://pzxc.com/use-a-password-manager-already?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+pzxc+(pzxc.com)">posts</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/12/the-dirty-truth-about-web-passwords.html">horror stories</a> berating me to do it, I finally did it. 


Anyways, back to the proxy; I bookmarked a few sites detailing how to accomplish this, there was one article about Ubuntu's <a href=https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/firewall.html">Uncomplicated Firewall</a> that looks...uncomplicated.  And there were others I found giving background on how to do it with <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/firewalls.html">FreeBSD</a>.  I have a decent desktop computer I don't use that I can install either operating system on (it already has CentOS and Win 7 installed).  


Once I figure this out I'm going to stop writing my blog in my VM on my laptop and hopefully have a set-up where I can ssh into my server, jot down a post from anywhere, and push it live.  In the meantime I'm going to try and get Disqus to work properly, hone my prose, and keep it real.
