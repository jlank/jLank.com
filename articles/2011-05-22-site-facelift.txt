title: Site Facelift
date: 22/05/2011

I have just updated my blog with some window-dressing, social media links, and  css.  Jump inside to see what else changed.~

So I haven't really modified this blog from it's original theme toto, until today.  Some of the things I added are the two new CSS3 buttons to the left which link out to my Facebook and Twitter accounts.  

I also added a robots.txt and humans.txt file to the site.  In the humans.txt file I shout out some of the tools I'm using for this site, like jquery, CSS3 buttons,  this blogging platform, and more.

Structurally, I've sprinkled some 960.gs  framework on here, in addition to some HTML5 semantic mark up.  

There's always more to do, but today I have laid some foundation.
