title: Housekeeping
date: 14/12/2010

Ok... time for some housekeeping; I need to configure this blogging platform <a href="http://www.cloudhead.io/toto">toto</a> a little bit.  I read about it on first <a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2010/02/06/blogging-simplified/">usability post</a> and it really piqued my interest.  It is very simple, easy to get up and running, and fast; all things I like.  The blogging application is built with Ruby, and I have it running on Heroku.  Getting this up and running has been a little lesson in DNS routing, git, and installing some things on my Ubuntu VM. 

I'm going to take some time and mess with the default settings and learn how to format my posts to have proper teasers, tags, and meta info.  Catch you later.
