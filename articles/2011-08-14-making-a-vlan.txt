title: Making a VLAN
date: 14/08/2011

Tomorrow I will have a brand new internet connection, sorry Clear, but your 4G
WiMax isn't cutting it in my new english basement!  With >400 ms response
times, writing this post on my new Linode VM is slightly painful.  After the
jump I'll detail what exactly I have in mind. ~

So, Comcast is a pain in the you know what.  For whatever reason, they could
not hook up my new apartment because my upstairs neighbors already have
service with them.  Therefore we got Direct TV with a Clear 4G WiMax hotspot.
It may be the bricks, moisture, low level of my apartment, whatever, but the
connection speed hovers around 750Kbps download, and ping latency is a joke.

This lead me to broker a deal with my neighbors to pump up their
service with Comcast to a 105Mbps plan.  Tomorrow I will run a CAT6 Ethernet
cable from a switch into my new Dual Band Buffalo router, and be done with
it.  If you are thinking of building a VLAN, below are the parts I purchased,
and I'll detail the steps to setting it up.

A quick side note, since both my neighbor and I work from home from time to
time, we needed to make sure our network traffic was secure and partitioned. 
 With this in mind, I remembered the utility of VLANs from my
 Telecomm/Enterprise Networks course (thanks Dr. Spina) and decided this was
 the best option.  Creating a VLAN will effectively secure our connections
 from occupying the samesubnet, and will cut down on broadcast messages
 (shouldn't really be an issue with such a small network).

And here is a ghetto topology I threw together in google docs, didn't have Visio handy at the time:

The fun parts of this project for me are configuring my Buffalo AirStation as it is 
a very feature full device.  Another fun thing is manufactuing the CAT6 cable and 
running it through the wall, I went with 100 feet, so I hope I don't mess up too much and
lose my slack!  On this note, my coworker Matt cautioned me on the high attenuation rate of Ethernet
cables as they approach 100 feet, however he was mistaken.  Ethernet attenuation starts
to creep in at 100 meters (330 feet), and I'm not certain, but I think CAT6 UTP may have
a greater distance (150 meters?), I have to check my notes. I'm more worried
about making a bad endpoint and getting cross talk which would degrade my
throughput considerably.

The final unknown in the project (as I have already manufactured cables and configured routers)
is the VLAN tagging at the switch.  I've yet to experience this process, but I can't
imagine it beeing more complicated than port forwarding on a router.  We shall see.
  The great thing about this switch is it is cheap because it
is an unmanaged switch that comes with software you install on your computer.

That's all for now, excuse the typos if there are any, it is hard to type with
all this lag!  Tomorrow I will get some of that fast internet and never look back. Initial 
speed tests were showing around 90Mbps down and 10Mbps up :) this will be my fastest home
connection to date.
